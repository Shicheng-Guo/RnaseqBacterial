### RNA-seq data to reveal novel response mechanism to bacterial within host wound tissues

Shicheng Guo, Sanjay Shukla, 2019

Sanjay introduced the research background and I proposed 3 analysis strategies and aims (12/09/2019)
* transcriptome different between wound tissues and normal tissues (skin and immnune cells)
* bacterial transcript nework and host transcript network correlation
* deconvolute mix host transcript patterns to sigle-cell contribution. 

#### Update:
* 12/10/2019: [24 sample id](./extdata/S24_id.txt) is extracted and wait for clinical information(urgent).
* check the raw data: /mnt/bigdata/Genetic/Projects/Shukla_cDNA/data/all_samples/*.fastq
* 12/09/2019: [IRB approved](Outcome_Letter_SUL10110_IRB00000673.pdf): Role of Putative Toxin Genes in Infections due to Community Associated MRSA
* 11/27/2019: /mnt/bigdata/Genetic/Projects/Shukla_cDNA/data/all_samples/*.fastq

* 11/25/2019: Terrie works to add me to IRB of Sanjay's `SUL10110`
* 11/23/2019: Further Discuss methylation in MS project with Sanjay
